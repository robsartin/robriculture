"""The Strategy interface every agent implements.

A Strategy is a pure decision function: given the parsed game state, return the
action dict for this turn. Keeping one signature means strategies are (a)
swappable in a submission and (b) able to fight each other in the local
tournament harness with zero glue code.

Action dict shape (per the competition spec):

    {
        "farmer": [ACTION, *args],      # exactly one action for the main farmer
        "hands":  [[ACTION, *args], ...],  # one per hired hand this day
        "market": [[ORDER, ITEM, N], ...], # up to maxMarketOrdersPerTurn (10)
    }
