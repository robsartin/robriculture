"""dawn_reserve: herd_first with the cash floor set to tomorrow's wages plus the herd's feed (#256).

#254's `herd_first` beat `third_herder` 14/16 and lost the field (madhur 5/16
against the champion's 11/16). The census said why: the sim clears
`farm["hands"]` every night and re-hires at dawn on the wage ladder (1, 1, 2,
3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 -- 143 for ten hands), and with a zero reserve the herd
block, which runs on every hour, spends every coin before dawn: 2-20 in hand,
2-5 hands, the crop line stalled at 11 tiles for six days, no feed wheat
against a strong opponent and head placed 9 -> 3. The buy order was the right
knob; zero reserve is wrong under daily re-hiring -- it fires the crew at dusk.

One decision changes: the herd's cash floor is what dawn will need --
tomorrow's wage bill for the crew the ramp asks for, plus the wheat the feed
block keeps for the herd standing today -- through the `capital_reserve` seam
(#252, #256). The buy order, `field_pace`'s eight knobs and `third_herder`'s
rules are inherited unchanged.

Declared before measurement: `wage_bill`, `feed_cost`, and the controls and
criterion in `harness/reserve_bench.py` (posted to #256 before any code).
