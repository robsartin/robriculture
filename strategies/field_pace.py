"""field_pace: the field's schedule on third_herder, as one package (#252).

A census of `third_herder` vs `pilkwang_structured_economic_policy` on spent
seeds 864-867 read the field's schedule straight off both boards (medians):
5 hands, 4 head and no cash reserve from day 0; strawberry from day 5; NE on
day 6 with 8 hands; 10 hands, 37 planted and 13 head by day 8; SW on day 11;
62 planted (38 strawberry, 24 wheat) by day 12; 14 pasture tiles inside NW;
12 hands by day 15. Closing money 128,904 to our 46,228 on seed 864.

#244 fronted the herd alone and #246 opened the pasture alone; both were
cash-limited before the melon payday on day 10. The field's edge is that it
spends every coin on growth from day 0, on every knob at once. This arm moves
them together -- hands, land, crop pivot, crop caps, tiles per hand, herd,
pasture block and cash reserve -- through the seams on the frozen benchmark
(#181, #202, #237, #246, #252), every value the median above and none tuned.
Inherited unchanged: the third herder from day 8, the lead of 3, #219's cow
rule, the benchmark's sell and feed rules.

Declared before measurement: every constant below, and the controls and
criterion in `harness/pace_bench.py` (posted to #252 before any code).
