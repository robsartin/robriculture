The 20 opponents the champion beats never exceed 6 melon or 4 strawberry and
median 35,607 — the two populations separate cleanly on crop mix alone.

This strategy exists to make the benchmark able to express that shape. The five
`DEFAULT_ANCHORS` are swept 20/20 by the champion and **not one of them plants a
single strawberry**, so every paired experiment recorded in this repository was
scored against a saturated instrument (#181).

It is flagged ``benchmark = True``: never packaged by ``scripts/submit.py``
(ADR-0005) and never eligible for promotion (``harness.promotion.top_contender``).
