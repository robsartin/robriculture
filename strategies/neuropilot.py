#: Flat-dollar reserve added to price, deliberately *not* scaled by price
#: (#100). #97's `price * 4 * (1/pace - 1)` buffer looked right on paper but
#: was calibrated against nothing observed: it demanded ~$37,000 at the
#: evolved genome's actual pace (~0.097) and ~$77,000 at pace 0.05, while the
#: champion never accumulates more than ~$17,900-$39,000 across a full
#: 720-turn game (harness/production_report.py measurement, #95/#96/#101) —
#: every pace value evolution actually visited was unaffordable, so the
#: "gradient" was flat and fitness-invisible in practice.
#:
#: #100 recalibrates by measurement instead of intuition. `production_report`
#: shows `pilkwang` (outscores us ~9:1) buying both its $1,000 and $2,000
#: quadrants near-broke, days apart, at similar low-thousands cash levels —
#: and our own `meta_rancher` buying both quadrants the same day at similar
#: cash levels too ($10.4k then $4.8k, *less* for the pricier SW). Buffer
#: size tracks observed reserve behaviour, not sale price, so it's additive
#: rather than multiplicative: at pace 0.05 (the highest pace the #97 run
#: ever visited despite it being a dead gene) the buffer is $15,200, putting
#: the ~$16,200 NE requirement and ~$17,200 SW requirement both inside the
#: observed money envelope — reachable late in a game, not never.

    at pace 1.0 the buffer is 0 (buy as soon as affordable, matching the
