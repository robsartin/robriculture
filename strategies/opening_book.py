"""Steal the opening book: replay a winner's first three days (issue #207).

#187, #193 and #196 all struggled with the *opening* -- pastures built late,
animals unplaced, feed absent -- while the field stands up 8-11 animals
routinely. So the hypothesis under test is that the herd is hard to
**establish**, not hard to run, and the cheapest way past a phase we are bad at
is to not play it: replay a real winner's recorded first three days verbatim,
then hand the board to an agent that keeps livestock.

Two decisions are load-bearing and both are #207's, not this module's:

* **The hand-over target is `dense_farm`.** The drafted idea handed to
  `neuropilot`, whose evolved genome sets ``herd_target_scale`` to a median
  0.0098 -- which ``_herd_targets`` rounds to **zero animals** (#187). It would
  have abandoned the herd on the turn it took control.
* **The opening is days 0-2**, i.e. the first ``OPENING_TURNS`` turns, and the
  hand-over is the very next turn. `strategies.field_rival.FieldRivalStrategy`
  (which `dense_farm` inherits) reads the whole board every turn and carries no
  cross-turn state, so it takes over a board it did not build cleanly.

The replay half is `strategies.ghost.Ghost` unchanged -- same script, same
``turn_index`` -- because the one trap here is the one #157 already paid for:
the action recorded at replay index ``t`` was applied to the observation at
index ``t-1``. Reading it at its own index scored a whole season at 994 against
an actual 48,144.

Deliberately **not registered**, exactly as `strategies/ghost.py` is: there is
no module-level ``STRATEGY``, so the auto-discovery in ``strategies/__init__.py``
skips this file. Without a book it is `dense_farm` wearing another name, and
registering that would enter a duplicate agent in the tournament and in
``tests/test_no_crash.py``'s beat-random floor. Books are built per replay by
``harness.opening_bench``, and are never committed -- a downloaded replay is
another competitor's play, and this repo does not vendor those (ADR-0005).
