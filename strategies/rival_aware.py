# strategies/rival_aware.py
"""Read the rival's herd off the board and keep ours out of their market (#219).

`dense_farm` with one decision changed: once the other farm has placed
SHEEP_THRESHOLD sheep, every animal we buy is a cow. Wool has one shop and
floors past ~300 units between the two farms (#146); milk has three shops and
570 season demand. Everything else -- crop caps, ramps, sells, land, feed --
is `dense_farm`'s, through the `herd_preference` seam on the frozen benchmark
(#181, #202).

Declared before measurement: the threshold, and the criterion in
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-rival-aware-herd-design.md.
